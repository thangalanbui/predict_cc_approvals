# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Banks receive numerous credit card applications every day and manually evaluating them, even with the help of a credit expert,  can monotonous, error-prone, and time-consuming. \
Fortunately, Machine Learning, specially Supervised Learning, can help automate this task in a time-saving and fairly accurate manner. In this project, I:

• Built a machine learning model with scikit-learn based on 690 credit card applications to predict their approval
status, with accuracy rate of 88% on test data \
• Preprocessed data with Median Imputation, Ordinal Encoder and Feature Scaling for model training\
• Implemented KNN, logistic regression and SVM algorithms, and Grid Search to find the best performing model
